              Welcome to Keys of Orthanc, a game of adventure set
                in the Third Age of Middle-earth,
                  when the world still rang with elven song
                    and gleamed with dwarven mail.
              Walk the dark pits of Isengard.
                Slay creatures black and fell.
                  Wrest the Keys from Saruman in his domain.
