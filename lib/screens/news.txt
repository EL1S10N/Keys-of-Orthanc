              Welcome to Sil, a game of adventure set
                in the First Age of Middle-earth,
                  when the world still rang with elven song
                    and gleamed with dwarven mail.
              Walk the dark halls of Angband.
                Slay creatures black and fell.
                  Wrest a shining Silmaril from Morgoth's iron crown.
