# This file provides information for monster "templates".
# 
# name : template name
# glyph : default display character
# pain : pain message index
# flags : flag | flag | ...
# desc : description
#
# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The template name is used in 
# monster.txt.
#
# 'glyph' indicates the default display character. This is used for displaying
# the monster in ASCII mode, and also for determining which monsters are
# of the same "type" for things like the ESCORT flag or the S_KIN summon.
#
# 'pain' indicates which set of "pain messages" (from pain.txt) is used.
#
# 'flags' indicates the flags that every monster inherits from this template.
#
# 'desc' indicates the textual description of this template that is used by
# the '/' command in-game.
#
# Note that these templates have references in other data files. Changing
# characteristics of monster bases is fine, but the names are referenced in
# several other data files (notably monster.txt), so any name changes will
# have to take this into account.
