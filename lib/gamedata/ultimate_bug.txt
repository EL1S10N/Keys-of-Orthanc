Against all hope, you defeated the Dark Enemy,
  and destroyed his physical form.
    For the rest of this age at least,
      Arda shall be free from the tyrant's shadow.
But there will be time later for reflection
  on this great change to Arda's fate.
    You are buried still in Angband's vaults
      -- make quick your bold escape!
