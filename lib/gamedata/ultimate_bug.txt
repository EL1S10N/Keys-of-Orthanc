Unlooked for, you have slain Saruman of Many Colours,
  against the councils of the Wise.
    Sauron still remains to contend with,
      yet a dire threat to Rohan is shattered.
Gandalf remains imprisoned atop Orthanc,
  and the halls boil with foes as news spreads.
    You are still buried in Isengard's pits
      -- make quick your bold rescue!
