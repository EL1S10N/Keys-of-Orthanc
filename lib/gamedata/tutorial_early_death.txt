You have been slain.
 
A key feature of Sil (and all Roguelike games) is that you cannot
use savepoints: if you die, that's it!
It is thus a challenging game where you need to really *think*.
 
However, it is a bit frustrating to die before the end of the
tutorial, so we evidentally made it a bit too deadly.
 
Just restart the tutorial and you should be back to where you
were in a couple of minutes. Remember that if combat is not going
your way, you can try to escape and heal, then either come back
and again to defeat your adversary, or simply ignore it.
