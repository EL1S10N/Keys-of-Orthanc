You have finished the first half of the tutorial and are ready
to create a new character.
 
Don't let the choices overwhelm you the first time.
Just start with the default Race and House, then invest most
of your starting experience in Melee and Evasion.
Once the game begins, finding some weapons and armour should
be your top priority.
 
Remember that a key feature of Sil (and all Roguelike games)
is that you cannot use savepoints: if you die, that's it.
It is thus a challenging game where you need to really *think*.
You will die many times. When you do: reflect on what to learn
from that death, see if you set a high score, then think about
all the things you want to do differently with the next character...
