Loud rose a din of laughter hoarse,
  self-loathing yet without remorse;
    loud came a singing harsh and fierce
      like swords of terror souls to pierce.
Red was the glare through open doors
  of firelight mirrored on brazen floors,
    and up the arches towering clomb
      to glooms unguessed, to vaulted dome
        swathed in wavering smokes and steams
          stabbed with flickering lightning-gleams.
