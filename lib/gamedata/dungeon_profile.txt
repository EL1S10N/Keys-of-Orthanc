# Contains information about how each type of dungeon level (and the town)
# are generated.

# name: The profile name.  This needs to match the corresponding entry in 
# list-dun-profiles.h so the correct level-building function can be called

# rooms: rooms
# The number of rooms to aim for.

# streamer: den : rng : qua
# Streamers are drawn as a random walk which stops at the dungeon edge.
# den is the number of grids near any walk grid to make streamer; rng is how
# far from the walk those grids can be; qua is the numbers of quartz streamers
# per level.

# room: name : hardness : level : random
# name is the room name, which must match the name in list-rooms.h so the 
# correct room-building function can be called.
# hardness is a rough measure of the depth that rooms appear.
# level is the depth at which this room is forced to appear.
# random (if not zero) gives the room a chance to appear if no earlier one has.
